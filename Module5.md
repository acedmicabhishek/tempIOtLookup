# Module V: Prototyping Online Components

## 1. Getting Started with an API
- **Description**: This section covers the basics of using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to connect IoT devices to online services. An API is a set of rules and tools for building software and applications. In the context of IoT, APIs are used to send data from devices to the cloud and to send commands from the cloud to devices.
- **Key Concepts**:
    - **API Keys**: Keys that are used to authenticate with an API.
    - **HTTP Methods**: The different methods that can be used to interact with an API, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
    - **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight data-interchange format that is commonly used for APIs.

## 2. Writing a New API
- **Description**: This section explains how to create your own API. This is useful when you need to create a custom service for your IoT devices to interact with.
- **Key Steps**:
    - **Choose a Framework**: There are many frameworks available for building APIs, such as Flask (Python), Express (Node.js), and Ruby on Rails (Ruby).
    - **Define the Endpoints**: The endpoints are the URLs that your API will expose.
    - **Implement the Logic**: The logic is the code that will be executed when an endpoint is called.
    - **Secure the API**: It is important to secure your API to prevent unauthorized access.

## 3. Real-Time Reactions
- **Description**: This section covers how to make your IoT devices react to events in real-time. This can be done using technologies such as WebSockets or MQTT.
- **Key Technologies**:
    - **WebSockets**: A protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
    - **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**: A lightweight messaging protocol that is designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency, or unreliable networks.

## 4. Other Protocols: MQTT, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
- **Description**: This section provides an overview of other protocols that are commonly used in IoT.
- **Key Protocols**:
    - **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**: A publish/subscribe-based messaging protocol that is ideal for IoT applications.
    - **XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)**: A protocol for real-time communication, which can be used for messaging, presence, and data exchange in IoT.
